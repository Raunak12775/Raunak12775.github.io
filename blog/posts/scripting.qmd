Knowledge of `python` is necessary for the upcoming discussion
::: 
Being a doctoral student in computational/theoretical chemistry writing script for daily reserarch is an essential part of our work. It can be using `bash` or `python` or `julia`. From my experience in all of these 3 scripting tools I realised that `python` works the best. Firstly, I will go through some basic functions or code snippets that I needed most of the time, and I hated writing it repeatedly.

**Write a python function that can read a `.xyz` coordinate file of a molecule.** 
:::
Let us assume it is H~2~ molecule.

```bash{code-line-numbers="true"}
2

H 0. 0. 0.
H 0. 0. 1.
```

the python function for reading the file and storing the  is 

```python{code-line-numbers="true"}
import numpy as np

def read_xyz_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        # Read the number of atoms
        num_atoms = int(file.readline().strip())
        
        # Read the comment line (if any)
        comment = file.readline().strip()
        
        # Initialize lists 
        # to store the atom types and coordinates
        atom_types = []
        coordinates = []
        
        for _ in range(num_atoms):
            line = file.readline().strip()
            if line:  
                parts = line.split()
                atom_type = parts[0]
                coord = list(map(float, parts[1:]))
                atom_types.append(atom_type)
                coordinates.append(coord)
        
        # Convert the coordinates list to a NumPy array
        coordinates = np.array(coordinates)
    
    return num_atoms, comment, atom_types, coordinates
```
