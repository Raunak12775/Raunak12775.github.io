## Born-Oppenheimer
## Quantum Chemistry and Schroedinger's Equation
Materials having one or more dimensions especially below 20 nm shows observable changes in optical, electronic, chemical and other properties than the material in bulk. These materials are prefixed with the word *quantum*[@levine2014quantum]. The word quantum is associated because of the behaviour of the particles is not anymore learnt by classical mechanics. Quantum mechanics is the answer for them. Quantum mechanics and Schroedinger equation are synonymous. The equation looks like following:

$$
\hat{H}\psi = E \psi
$${#eq-se}

Apparently it might look very straightforward equation but when one expands the operator, it leads to partial differential equation. And due to unknown nature of the two electron operator one cannot exactly solve it beyond H atom. So, then comes the approximations. And the approximation that I use it in my thesis is the most basic one but the elegant one (personal opinion) called Hartree-Fock Theory[@levine2014quantum].

## Hartree-Fock (HF) Theory
In @eq-se there are two parts where the approximation can be made - Hamiltonian 
## Multiresolution Analysis
Let us assume there is a function f(x)

## Molecules in Strong Magnetic Field
There are some atoms that theoretically and practically do not form bonds in earthly environment. One of the example that we know is helium dimer, i.e. He~2~. If we consider [Molecular Orbital Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_orbital_theory) we will see that He~2~ does not exist.
