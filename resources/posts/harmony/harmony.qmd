Nature is very powerful than human beings. If you mess with nature even with a slightest bit, the whole mankind suffers a huge loss. Think about a situation like global warming which is making the headlines for many years now. But I think human-beings are either yet to understand the consequences or they are in denial. So, one of the direct impact that the glaciers melt and the sea level rises maybe by a little amount considering the vastness of the oceans. It can result into a deadly tsunami. Then we have outcries from global west about the climate protests that goes on which are mainly from a neoliberal and privileged classes of people. I feel the protests are a bit non-sensical if the awareness is not spread to the bottom of the societies. With the immense amount of neoliberalisation of economy as well as huge amount of industrialisation, we first created the divide into the societies in regards to access of education. Now with the tech-revolution we are creating a digital divide aka information divide as well. I believe we are lacking the sense of creating awareness among our children how to create a harmonious living within nature. Instead we are creating a pool of new life that are knowing how to artificially create nature around ourselves. Reports have shown that we are already the apex predator of our ecosystem already. The next thing that we are trying to do is also take control of the nature.

I believe taking control of the nature for the human-beings is just like driving a car into a busy and crowded streets after getting 10 driving lessons from driving-school. We need to take it slow and patiently. Nature is lot greater and intelligent than us. We need to get long it with the nature's flow rather than trying to get a grip on it. When in the morning I go for running and after 3 km, I feel a bit exhausted and my walking feels like gliding. At that moment I cross a man made alley of some ling trees that look like eucalyptus but they are not, I feel as if they are telling me something. The silence of the trees are so loud. I open my palms and stretch my fingers apart. The cold breeze flowing through the empty spaces between my fingers are so fulfilling and relaxing. We need to enjoy the nature naturally. But in the moment I see it as a very artificial act.
