To solve Schroedinger Equation for even the smallest possible molecule can be complicated as the simplest molecule contains two nuclei and one electron. And hence all the molecular theories start with the follwing precious assumption. Without this molecular theories would have had a real bad time. 

## Born-Oppenheimer Approximation
 
The assumption starts with a simple fact:

**Nucleus is heavier in mass than an Electron**

This simplifies the mathematics to a big extent. How? Let's see together.

## Time Independent Schroedinger Equation

Let's put all the pieces together of a time independent Schroedinger Equation, so the equation looks like the following

$$
\hat{H} \psi = E \psi
$${#eq-1}

Now we will write the Hamiltonian explicitly from @eq-1

$$
\hat{H} = \hat{H}_e + \hat{H}_N=-\frac{\nabla^2_e}{2} -\frac{\nabla^2_N}{2} + V_{ee} - V_{Ne} + V_{NN} 
$$

Here, the operators subscripted with $e$ represents electronic operators and $N$ represents nuclear operators.
