# Welcome to my personal website

Hello! Hallo! Hola! Ciao! 

I am Raunak and I am currently doing my doctorate in Theoretical Chemistry in Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin. I am a method developer, primarily focussing in the field of *Multiresolution-Resolution Analysis*. I love computers and programming and I have an expertise in `Fortran77`, `C++`, `Julia` and `Python`. Besides science I love to cook and am an avid music lover, I play guitar and uke. 

I love teaching, hence you will find my tutorial videos and lecture notes in the [teaching](teaching/teach.qmd) section of this website.

For relevant research collaboration please contact me through my [email](mailto:farhazra@hu-berlin.de).

**Nice to meet you !**
