I am doing a PhD in Theoretical Chemistry at Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin. I love computers, mathematics,and a little bit of chemistry. I love music, cooking, and movies. I am trying to write a book which soon maybe get published. Check the [blog](./resources/blog.qmd) to know more about my cooking skills and [research](./resources/research.qmd) to know more about my works. The [learn](./resources/teach.qmd) section is for some of my teaching resources.
