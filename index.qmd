I am currently doing my Doctorate in Theoretical Chemistry in **Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin**. 
I do method developmentand my primary focus is in the field of [**Multiresolution Analysis**]().
 I love computers and programming and I have an expertise in `Fortran77`, `C++`, `Julia` and `Python`. 
 Besides science I love to cook and am an avid music lover. 

I love teaching, hence you will find my tutorial videos and lecture notes in the [teaching](teaching/teach.qmd) section of this website.

For relevant research collaboration please contact me through my [email](mailto:farhazra@hu-berlin.de).
