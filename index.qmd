I am currently doing my Doctorate in Theoretical Chemistry in **Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin**. 
I do method developmentand my primary focus is in the field of [**Multiresolution Analysis**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S006532761930019X?via%3Dihub). The former link redirects to one of the review article written by Florian Bischoff on the topic. Nice and easy read.

I love computers and programming. Besides science I love to cook and am an avid music lover. 

I love teaching, hence you will find my tutorial videos and lecture notes in the [teaching](resources/teach.qmd) section of this website.

For relevant research collaboration please contact me through my [work email](mailto:farhazra@hu-berlin.de) or my [personal email](mailto:farhazraunak@proton.me)
