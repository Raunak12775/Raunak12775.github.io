These materials are prefixed with the word quantum1. The word quantum is associated because of the behaviour of the particles is not anymore learnt by classical mechanics. Quantum mechanics is the answer for them. Quantum mechanics and Schroedinger equation are synonymous. The equation looks like following:\n\\[\n\\hat{H}\\psi = E \\psi\n\\tag{1}\\]\nApparently it might look very straightforward equation but when one expands the operator, it leads to partial differential equation. And due to unknown nature of the two electron operator one cannot exactly solve it beyond H atom. So, then comes the approximations. And the approximation that I use it in my thesis is the most basic one but the elegant one (personal opinion) called Hartree-Fock Theory1."
